* ScreenManager																*
* 																			*
* 'Screens' are held in a stack (implemented with a vector),				*
* and new screens are pushed and popped onto and off this stack.			*
* All screens in the stack are drawn, but only the top one is updated.		*
* The idea of the screen system is to create a separate screen for each		*
* 'screen' that the player will be seeing. This includes the main menu,		*
* each level of the game, pause screens, game over screens... and so on.	*
* The idea of them being in a stack allows a pause screen to still show		*
* the level the player was playing in the background, and to go back to		*
* /exactly/ the point in the level they were at after unpausing, as the		*
* pause screen would be popped off the top of the stack, causing the level	*
* screen to begin updating again.											*
* 																			*
* Lol, long text is long.													*
